			<h2> The effectiveness of background checks in preventing mass shootings in the United States. </h2>
			<h4> The rise of mass shootings in the United States reveals patterns in the backgrounds of mass shooters from 1966-2019. <br>Brooke Vaccaro</h4>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>From 1966-2019 there were 171 mass shootings in the United States. These shootings are categorized as “mass” because they were “an incident in which four or more people are killed with a firearm, excluding the perpetrator”, as defined by <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/07/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-rise-in-u-s-mass-shootings" target="_blank">The Marshall Project</a>. They ranged from killing four people and injuring none, to killing 58 and injuring another 887. Their frequency has risen in recent years and according to data from <a href="https://www.theviolenceproject.org/mass-shooter-database/" target="_blank">The Violence Project's</a> extensive mass shooter database, in the past five years there were more total shootings than in every other half decade tracing back to 1966. With just over 38% of shootings occurring in the South, it is the region of the country where the most shootings occur. While California is the state with the most shootings having the same percentage, 16%, as all of the northern states combined, the South is home to two out of the top three states with the most number of shootings: Texas and Florida. The South is the part of the country in which most states do not, and historically have not, require background checks on gun sales by unlicensed sellers. This contributes to the fact that, in the United States, mass shootings occur when criminal background checks, on gun sales by unlicensed sellers, are not required 1.8 times that of when they are required.

				Mass shootings have become an epidemic in our country and at their root lies the relationship between the shooters themselves and the weapons they use. While some states do require background checks when purchasing firearms, especially when purchasing from unlicensed sellers, it is a process that has room for vast improvement in order to decrease the number of mass shootings. Data reveals that there are patterns in shooter backgrounds which can be utilized to decide who gets to purchase a gun.

			<h3>Criminal record's of mass shooters</h3>
			<p>The rate of shooters having a criminal record prior to the shooting is 1.89 times more than those who do not have a criminal record. While it is not stated specifically what exactly these criminal records are, such as if they involve firearms and violence or not, data displays that it is something that shooters tend to have in common.

			<h3>Mental health status of mass shooters</h3>
			<p>A past of having a criminal record is not the only commonality that appears in perpetrators of mass shootings. The rate of shooters having mental health disorders is just above 2 times more than those who do not. While the majority does not have a diagnosed disorder, it is a very slight amount of just above half and 64% of those individuals show signs of a disorder but just lack a psychiatric diagnosis. The remaining percentage of shooters, 48%, display a majority of mood disorders and thought disorders- separate or together- as well as psychiatric disorders.

				Dr. Jillian Peterson, co-founder, president and main contributor of <a href="https://www.theviolenceproject.org/mass-shooter-database/" target="_blank">The Violence Project's</a> mass shooter database is an expert in violence prevention, the justice system, mental illness, forensic pathology and data-driven policy. In episode 209,<a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/mass-shootings" target="_blank"> “How to stop mass shootings”</a>, of the American Psychology Association’s podcast, Speaking of Psychology, Peterson touches upon this topic. She states that “we did find most mass shooters, about two-thirds, have some sort of mental health history”. From her own research, she has found out that “the number of perpetrators who attempted suicide before was astounding” and by talking to shooters themselves has discovered a disturbing consistency: ‘they said that they went in to be killed by police, or they went in planning to kill themselves”. Peterson reveals the thought process of the perpetrators as “be killed, kill yourself, or spend the rest of your life in prison”.

				Mental health records do appear on background checks when they are required to purchase a firearm for a reason that is supported by not only the data that Jillian Petrson, PhD, collected but also from shooters statements themselves and are just another factor that points in the direction of background checks being useful.

			<h3>Patterns can be broken</h3>
			<p>
				While data does prove there are patterns that appear in mass shooters, we cannot make the claim that all shooters display these traits or that all people who display these traits are shooters. Correlation, in this sense or any sense, does not prove causation and as Jillian Peterson claims “trying to pick out a diagnosis and say, this is what these perpetrators have in common, you absolutely can’t do that”. Data reveals trends, but there are always exceptions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, there will also always be individuals who work their way around background checks, specifically adolescents who perpetrate school shootings and take guns from their parents, and illegally come into possession of firearms. However, as Peterson emphasizes “we need gun control laws” whether it be by more in-depth background checks or raising the minimum age or and creating waiting periods and permits, a system that makes gun acquisition stricter and understands what this data tells us needs to be exercised. As Puglielli supports “SOMETHING ABOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS”, it is clear that there are ways to utilize the knowledge of these data patterns to regulate the purchase of guns and, hopefully, regulate the amount of mass shootings in the United States in the future.
